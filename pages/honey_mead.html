        <h2>The Honey Mead</h2>
        <img src="./../images/mead.jpg" alt="image of homemade honey mead">

        <p>All homemade mead is made from a similar honey mead recipe because it is simply a fermented beverage (like beer) made from honey, water, and yeast.</p>
        <p>It is one of the oldest fermented beverages known to man.</p>
        <p>Additions of fruit can make it sweeter or drier, depending on the amount of honey used. The type of yeast can also play a role here.</p>
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>filtered water (or distilled)</li>
            <li><strong>2-3 pounds</strong> honey (local raw honey is best)</li>
            <li><strong>2 g</strong> champagne yeast </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Simmer <em>half</em> gallon of water until warm</li>
            <li>Add honey: 2 pounds for a dry mead or 3 pounds for a sweet mead. Stir until dissolved.</li>
            <li>Simmer <em>(don't boil)</em> for about 30 minutes, skimming off any scum that forms. Remove from heat and let cool to about 100°F and pour into 1 gallon carboy.</li>
            <li>Add any extra ingredients you may want.</li>
            <li>When the temperature is below 90°F, add the yeast. One package will make 5 gallons of mead, so use between ⅕ of a package and ½ a package. I typically make two gallons at a time and divide the package between the two.</li>
            <li>Cap the bottle and shake well. Add more water to fill the bottle, making sure to leave <strong>3-4 inches</strong> of headroom at the top. Take the top off and add an airlock. These are available at your local homebrew store or online.</li>
            <li>Once the airlock is in place, set the bottle in a cool spot for about<strong> 6 weeks</strong>.</li>
            <Li>Enjoy!</Li>
        </ol>
